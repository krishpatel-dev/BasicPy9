## üõ† Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Basic understanding of Python syntax and data structures

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/krishpatel-dev/BasicPy9.git
   cd BasicPy9
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (recommended)**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

### Usage

Run any script using Python:
```bash
python path/to/script.py
```

Example:
```bash
python Proj9_blind_auction.py
```

## üìö Project Details

### 1. Blind Auction (Proj9_blind_auction.py)
- **Purpose**: Conduct a blind auction where bidders can place bids without seeing others' bids
- **Features**:
  - Multiple bidders can participate
  - Bids are kept secret until the auction ends
  - Clear winner announcement with the highest bid
  - ASCII art for better presentation

### 2. Country Travel Tracker (country_traveled.py)
- **Functionality**:
  - Tracks countries the user has visited
  - Prevents duplicate entries
  - Simple command-line interface

### 3. Dictionary Operations (dictionary.py)
- **Demonstrates**:
  - Basic dictionary creation and manipulation
  - Accessing and modifying dictionary elements
  - Dictionary methods and operations

### 4. Nesting Examples (nesting.py)
- **Shows**:
  - Nested dictionaries and lists
  - Complex data structures
  - Accessing and modifying nested elements

### 5. Student Grading (student_grading.py)
- **Features**:
  - Tracks student grades
  - Calculates average scores
  - Demonstrates dictionary usage for grade management

### 6. Python REPL (replet.py)
- **Purpose**:
  - Simple Read-Eval-Print Loop implementation
  - Basic command execution
  - Exit command handling

### 7. ASCII Art (art.py)
- **Contains**:
  - ASCII art used in the blind auction program
  - Visual elements for better user experience

## üß™ Testing

You can test the programs with different inputs to see how they behave. For example:

```bash
# Run the blind auction
python Proj9_blind_auction.py
# Follow the prompts to place bids

# Test the country tracker
python country_traveled.py
# Enter countries you've visited

# Try the dictionary examples
python dictionary.py
```
